# Pricing Matrix — Kaji Agentic Engineering

This matrix standardizes internal pricing assumptions for estimates. Use it to calculate the Kaji price and a comparable traditional estimate.

## Per-Stream Pricing by Complexity

| Complexity | Typical Scope | Streams | Per-Stream Price | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|---------|------------------|-------|
| Simple | Single integration, dashboard, prototype, chatbot, automation workflow, single API | 1 | $8K–15K | Use upper range when compliance, production hardening, or strict SLA is required. |
| Medium | Multi-source pipeline, ML model, copilot, multi-step automation, API platform, multi-integration | 2–3 | $10K–15K | Pick mid-to-upper range for heavy data engineering or prompt/model tuning. |
| Complex | Full product, multi-system build, production deployment with scaling, data platform, enterprise app | 4–6 | $10K–12K | Complex assumes volume; use lower end when streams ≥5. |

## Engagement Model Multipliers

Apply these to the **Kaji base subtotal**:

| Engagement Model | Multiplier | Description |
|------------------|------------|-------------|
| Shakudo Agentic Team | 1.0 | Full delivery by Shakudo (default) |
| Co-Development | 0.85 | Client shares meaningful build work |
| Client-Led with Kaji | 0.5 | Platform + onboarding only |

## Traditional Estimate Formulas

Traditional estimates are mapped by complexity:

| Complexity | Traditional Cost | Traditional Timeline |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Simple | $50K–100K | 2–3 months |
| Medium | $150K–300K | 3–6 months |
| Complex | $300K–700K+ | 6–12+ months |

**Total Traditional Cost** = sum of all use case ranges.

**Traditional Timeline** = longest complexity tier + 0.5–1 month per additional medium/complex use case.

## Volume Discount Rules (5+ Streams)

These rules reduce pricing for larger engagements:

1. **5–7 streams**: Price each stream at the **low end** of the tier range.
2. **8+ streams**: Use low-end per-stream pricing **and** apply an additional **5% discount** to the subtotal.
3. **Complex tier** already assumes volume pricing; default to **$10K** per stream when streams ≥5.

All discounts are internal and subject to Robert’s final review.
